# About

**ScientificGo** is a collection of [Go](https://www.golang.org) packages for scientific computing
designed for maximal portability and usability. Go naturally lends itself to these 
properties and that is why all ScientificGo packages are *pure* Go. With no C bindings, no assembly
and no Makefiles, ScientificGo packages offer a completely platform-independent setup without
sacrificing performance.
