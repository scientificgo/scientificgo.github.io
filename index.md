**ScientificGo** is a collection of [Go](https://www.golang.org) packages for scientific computing. Designed for maximal portability and high-performance, ScientificGo packages are pure-Go; there are no hidden bindings to C, no architecture-dependent assembly implementations and no `Makefile` build processes.

# Installation

You can use `go get` to download and install ScientificGo packages on any platform. It couldn't be simpler. To install the package [`fft`]({{site.url}}), for example:

```
go get github.com/scientificgo.org/fft
```
